# PlagarismChecker
This is a plagarism checker for CSC-3400-01: Artificial Intelligence at Belmont University. We will be creating a plagarism checker 
with capabilities for both CPP and C code

The dataset we used is from https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/programming-homework-dataset-plagiarism-detection

To get the code running, you will have to download the databse from this site, as it was much too large for github to process, and put it in an order where the main program and the src folder are on the same level, otherwise my processing won't work. My setup is ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71861100/205502585-37e20fa0-d056-4622-8f90-1b297d8413a5.png)
